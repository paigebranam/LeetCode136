# LeetCode136
Leet Code Problem #136 - Single Number ; In Java, C++, and Python 
The same leetcode problem written in the three languages I am using for school this semester. 
The Java code is the most efficient because it's the language I felt most comfortable implementing XOR, something I've learned about this semester. 
XOR also saved the most lines of code in Java, as I would've needed to write loops + else/elseif statements to achieve the same result I did in C++ and Python.
